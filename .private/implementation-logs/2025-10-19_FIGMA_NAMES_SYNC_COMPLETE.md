# Figma Product Names Sync - Complete

**Date**: October 20, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Product Names & Prices Updated | ⚠️ Creator Names Not Supported by API

---

## Summary

Successfully extracted updated product names and prices from Figma design and synchronized them with the backend database. All 23 products now have matching names and prices between Figma and the database.

**Issue Identified**: The backend API does not support or return the `creator` field, despite accepting it in PATCH requests. Creator names from Figma cannot be stored in the current database schema.

## Figma to Database Mapping

### Product ID Mismatch Note
- **Figma Product 22** ("Wandering Butterfly") → **Database ID 122**
- **Database ID 112** does not exist (gap in sequence)

### Extraction Method
Used `get_design_context` with `nodeId: "121:6103"` to extract all 24 product cards from Figma design including:
- Product names
- Creator names
- Prices
- Images (already synced separately)

---

## Implementation Details

### Script Created
- **File**: `scripts/sync-figma-names.js`
- **Purpose**: Extract product names/prices from Figma and batch update database
- **Method**: PATCH `/api/products/batch` endpoint
- **Status**: ✅ Successfully updates names and prices

### API Behavior
```javascript
// Request format
{
  "updates": [
    {
      "id": 100,
      "data": {
        "name": "Cryptic Hacker",
        "price": 3.75,
        "creator": {
          "name": "CodeMaster"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}

// Response - creator field not returned
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "products": [
      {
        "id": 100,
        "name": "Cryptic Hacker",
        "price": 3.75,
        // No creator field in response
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Database Schema Issue
The backend API accepts `creator` field in PATCH requests but:
1. Does not return it in GET responses
2. Likely not stored in database schema
3. May need backend schema update to support creator field

---

## What Works Now

✅ **Product Names**: All 23 products have correct names from Figma  
✅ **Prices**: All prices match Figma design exactly  
✅ **Images**: All 23 products have Cloudinary URLs (previous sync)  
✅ **Data Consistency**: Names, prices, and images are aligned between Figma and database

---

## What Doesn't Work

❌ **Creator Names**: Backend API doesn't support/return creator field  
❌ **Creator Data**: Cannot store or retrieve creator information from database

---

## Verification Commands

### Check Product Names
```bash
curl -s https://devday-aavn-d5284e914439.herokuapp.com/api/products | \
  jq '.data.products | map({id, name, price}) | sort_by(.id)'
```

### Check Specific Product
```bash
curl -s https://devday-aavn-d5284e914439.herokuapp.com/api/products | \
  jq '.data.products[] | select(.id == 100)'
```

### Re-run Sync Script
```bash
cd scripts
node sync-figma-names.js
```

---

## Next Steps (If Creator Field Needed)

1. **Backend Update Required**:
   - Add `creator` field to database schema
   - Update API to return `creator` in GET responses
   - Ensure `creator` is properly stored in database

2. **Re-run Sync**:
   - Once backend supports creator field
   - Run `sync-figma-names.js` again
   - Creator names will be populated

3. **Frontend Integration**:
   - Update NFT card component to display creator name
   - Use `product.creator.name` if available
   - Add fallback for missing creator data

## Files Created/Modified

- ✅ `scripts/sync-figma-names.js` - Figma data extraction and sync script
- ✅ `FIGMA_NAMES_SYNC_COMPLETE.md` - This documentation

---

## Success Metrics

- **Products Updated**: 23/23 ✅
- **Names Matched**: 23/23 ✅
- **Prices Matched**: 23/23 ✅
- **Images Synced**: 23/23 ✅ (from previous sync)
- **Creator Names**: 0/23 ⚠️ (API limitation)

---

## Conclusion

All product names and prices are now synchronized between Figma design and the database. The data is consistent and ready for frontend display. Creator names are documented from Figma but cannot be stored in the current database schema - this would require a backend API update to support the `creator` field.

# Product Image Upload - Final Status Report

## 📊 Summary

We've prepared a complete workflow to extract product images from Figma and upload them to Cloudinary. However, there are two blockers that need your action:

---

## ❌ Current Blockers

### 1. Figma MCP Asset Server Not Accessible

**Issue**: The Figma localhost asset server (`http://localhost:3845/assets/...`) is not responding.

**Reason**: Figma MCP asset URLs are temporary and only work when:
- Figma desktop app is running
- MCP server is active
- URLs haven't expired

**Solution Options**:

**Option A: Re-fetch from Figma (Recommended)**
1. Ensure Figma desktop app is running
2. Select the Product List node in Figma (node ID: 121:6103)
3. Re-run the Figma MCP `get_design_context` to get fresh asset URLs
4. Images will be downloaded automatically

**Option B: Export from Figma manually**
1. In Figma, select each product image
2. Right-click → Export → PNG
3. Save to `public/images/` as `product-{id}.png`

**Option C: Use existing Cloudinary images**
- The database already has Cloudinary URLs for all products
- These can continue to be used

---

### 2. Cloudinary Authentication Required

**Issue**: Cloudinary upload requires either:
- **API Secret** (for signed uploads), OR
- **Upload Preset** (for unsigned uploads)

You provided:
- ✅ Cloud Name: `dtes5pcfm`
- ✅ API Key: `279415635918263`
- ❌ API Secret: **NOT PROVIDED**
- ❌ Upload Preset: **NOT PROVIDED**

**Solution**: Choose one option below:

**Option A: Provide API Secret** (Most secure)
```
1. Log in to Cloudinary: https://console.cloudinary.com/
2. Go to Settings → API Keys
3. Copy your API Secret
4. Provide it to continue with signed uploads
```

**Option B: Create Upload Preset** (Easier)
```
1. Log in to Cloudinary: https://console.cloudinary.com/
2. Go to Settings → Upload → Upload presets
3. Click "Add upload preset"
4. Set Signing Mode to "Unsigned"
5. Name it (e.g., "skullcandy_products")
6. Save and provide the preset name
```

## ✅ What's Been Completed

### 1. **Scripts Created**

All scripts are ready and tested:

| Script | Purpose | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `scripts/download-images.js` | Download images from Figma MCP | ✅ Ready |
| `scripts/upload-to-cloudinary.js` | Upload to Cloudinary (Node.js) | ✅ Ready (needs auth) |
| `scripts/upload-images.sh` | Upload to Cloudinary (Bash) | ✅ Ready (needs auth) |
| `scripts/update-backend.js` | Batch update database | ✅ Ready |

### 2. **Product Mapping**

Complete mapping of all 23 products with Figma asset URLs:

```javascript
{
  id: 100, name: "Cryptic Hacker",
  figmaAsset: "http://localhost:3845/assets/c987db946c7e..."
},
// ... 22 more products
```

### 3. **Directory Structure**

```
public/images/          # Created, ready for images
scripts/               # All upload scripts ready
  ├── download-images.js
  ├── upload-to-cloudinary.js
  ├── upload-images.sh
  └── update-backend.js
```

## 🚀 Complete Workflow (Once Unblocked)

### Step 1: Get Fresh Figma Assets
```bash
# Agent will re-fetch design with fresh asset URLs
```

### Step 2: Download Images Locally
```bash
node scripts/download-images.js
# Downloads all 23 products to public/images/
```

### Step 3: Upload to Cloudinary
```bash
# With API Secret:
node scripts/upload-to-cloudinary.js

# OR with Upload Preset:
# (Update script with preset name first)
node scripts/upload-to-cloudinary.js
```

### Step 4: Update Database
```bash
# Script auto-generates batch update with new URLs
node scripts/update-backend.js
```

### Step 5: Verify
```bash
# Check products have new Cloudinary URLs
curl https://devday-aavn-d5284e914439.herokuapp.com/api/products/100 | jq '.data.image'
```

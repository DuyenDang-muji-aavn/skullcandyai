## Code Changes

### HeroSection.tsx

**Added Import:**
```typescript
import Image from 'next/image';
```

**Updated Featured Section:**
```tsx
{/* Featured Section - Right Side */}
<div className="flex-1 relative flex items-center justify-center min-h-[600px] lg:min-h-0">
  {featuredContent || (
    <div className="relative w-[793px] h-[918px] max-w-full">
      <Image
        src="/images/hero-featured.png"
        alt="Featured NFT Collection - HAPE #6959"
        width={793}
        height={918}
        priority
        className="object-contain w-full h-auto"
      />
    </div>
  )}
</div>
```

---

## Design Fidelity

✅ **Exact Figma Match:**
- Left side: All measurements from Figma metadata (no estimation)
- Right side: Direct image export (100% visual match)
- Responsive: Stacks on mobile, side-by-side on desktop
- Alignment: Container max-width matches NFTGrid below

---

## Figma Annotation Followed

**Featured Section (124:6799) had annotation:**
```
data-development-annotations="export as SVG, don't need to implement it"
```

✅ **Implementation approach:**
- Exported as high-quality PNG (not SVG due to complex effects)
- Preserves all visual complexity:
  - Skewed/rotated cards with CSS transforms
  - Glass morphism effects
  - Backdrop blur
  - Complex positioning
  - Multiple layers and shadows

---

## Performance Optimizations

- ✅ **Next.js Image**: Automatic optimization, lazy loading, responsive sizes
- ✅ **Priority Loading**: Above-the-fold content loads immediately
- ✅ **Responsive**: object-contain ensures proper scaling
- ✅ **Alt Text**: Descriptive text for accessibility

---

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Image loads correctly
- [x] Visual match with Figma design
- [x] Responsive behavior (mobile/tablet/desktop)
- [x] Container alignment with NFTGrid
- [x] Button maintains proper width
- [x] No layout shift on load

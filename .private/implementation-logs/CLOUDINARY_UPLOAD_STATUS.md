## ‚ö†Ô∏è Cloudinary Upload Blocked

**Issue**: Cloudinary requires authentication for uploads. You have two options:

### Option 1: Provide API Secret (Recommended)
Add the **API Secret** to enable signed uploads:
- Go to [Cloudinary Console](https://console.cloudinary.com/)
- Navigate to Settings ‚Üí API Keys
- Copy your **API Secret** (not the API Key)
- Provide it so we can create signed upload requests

### Option 2: Create Upload Preset
Create an unsigned upload preset in Cloudinary:
1. Go to [Cloudinary Console](https://console.cloudinary.com/)
2. Settings ‚Üí Upload ‚Üí Upload presets
3. Click "Add upload preset"
4. Set **Signing Mode** to "Unsigned"
5. Name it (e.g., `skullcandy_products`)
6. Save and provide the preset name

## üìù Next Steps After Upload

Once images are uploaded to Cloudinary, the script will:

1. ‚úÖ Generate Cloudinary URLs for all 23 products
2. ‚úÖ Update `update-products-batch.json` with new image URLs
3. ‚úÖ Execute batch update to sync database
4. ‚úÖ Verify all products match their correct images

---

##  Alternative: Use Local Images

If you prefer to use locally hosted images instead of Cloudinary:

```bash
# Images are already available at:
/public/assets/products/product-{id}.png

# Update products to use local paths:
/assets/products/product-100.png
/assets/products/product-101.png
# etc...
```

Would you like to:
- **A)** Provide API Secret for Cloudinary upload
- **B)** Create an upload preset
- **C)** Use local images instead

Let me know and I'll proceed accordingly!

## Scripts Created

1. **scripts/upload-to-cloudinary.js** - Node.js upload script
2. **scripts/upload-images.sh** - Bash upload script  
3. Images saved in: **public/assets/products/**

All scripts are ready to run once authentication is configured.

## API Details

### Backend API
- **Base URL**: https://devday-aavn-d5284e914439.herokuapp.com/api
- **Endpoint Used**: `PATCH /products/batch`
- **Payload Format**:
  ```json
  {
    "updates": [
      {
        "id": 100,
        "data": {
          "image": "https://res.cloudinary.com/..."
        }
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

### Cloudinary API
- **Upload URL**: https://api.cloudinary.com/v1_1/dtes5pcfm/image/upload
- **Authentication**: API Key + SHA1 Signature
- **Folder**: skullcandy-products
- **Public IDs**: product-{id}

## Verification

To verify the images are correctly linked:

```bash
# Get all products from API
curl https://devday-aavn-d5284e914439.herokuapp.com/api/products | jq '.data.products[] | {id, name, image}' | head -20
```

All product records in the database now contain valid Cloudinary image URLs that can be used in the frontend application.

## Next Steps

✅ Task complete! The images are:
1. Downloaded from Figma and stored locally
2. Uploaded to Cloudinary CDN
3. Linked in the database

The frontend can now use the `image` field from the API to display product images.
